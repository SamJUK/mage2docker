# Mage2Docker

This project intends to create a performant and easily replicable local environment for Magento 2 Development. We leverage docker to configure the environment so that we can completely kill the "it works on my machine" debate during the course of Magento 2 development.

## Prerequisites
* Docker
    * [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install)
    * [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* Composer
    * [Installation w/ PHP](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
    * [Installation w/ Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/composer)
* An existing Magento 2 project
    * [v2.3 w/ Composer](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/composer.html)

## Getting Started
This project assumes you have already created a Magento 2 project with composer.

You can read the docs on the Magento website on [how to create a new Magento 2 project](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/composer.html). We strongly recommend using composer.
